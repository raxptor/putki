Using Putki with C# runtime
===========================

Make sure to include all the sources from the Putki C# runtime library, this
can be found under the path src/csharp-runtime in the putki repository. You
should probably set this up as a static library in your build environment.

Then also add in the generated files (by default the _gen folder), that you
have gotten from running the putki compiler in your source tree.


Reading un-built JSON data
--------------------------

If you are not building your data, and just want to read the .json files
from your data/objs folder, you can do this with the Mixki utilities both in
the generated code and the Putki library.

```
Mixki.SourceLoader sl = new Mixki.SourceLoader("/path/to/project/data/objs", Mixki.TestProj.Parsers);
Outki.MyDataObject dataObject = sl.Resolve<Outki.MyDataObject>("path/to/obj");
```

And then you are ready. The path 'path/to/obj' is the Putki path within your
objs folder. The code above will load the JSON data file, along with all its
dependencies from:

```
/path/to/project/data/objs/path/to/obj.json
```

The data objects you get this way are the data types you have defined. The
classes and structs defined in the compiler generated sources. 

Reading built data
------------------

The code below reads the same data as above, but from a binary package
generated by the data builder (that you have compiled, and in which you have
defined the default.pkg to be generated, along with what it should contain).

```
Putki.PackageManager.LoadFromBytes(
        System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes("/path/to/project/out/csharp-default/packages/default.pkg"),
        new TypeLoader()
);

Outki.MyDataObject everything = Putki.PackageManager.Resolve<Outki.MyDataObject>("path/to/obj");
```
